# üöÄ CodingGita Hackathon Task Brief

## **Challenge Title:** Real-time Website Blocking for Your Hotspot

## 1. Problem Statement

Build a **real-time website-blocking system** for a local hotspot where:

* A **laptop acts as the Wi-Fi Access Point (AP)** and gateway for the room.
* All users connect to that laptop Wi-Fi network.
* The laptop enforces **domain-level blocking** (e.g., `facebook.com`, `youtube.com`, `chatgpt.com`).
* An **admin UI (mobile-friendly)** allows an administrator to **block/unblock domains in real time** and view connected clients.

The final setup must be demonstrable locally: client connects ‚Üí admin blocks a domain ‚Üí client loses access ‚Üí admin unblocks ‚Üí client regains access.

---

## 2. Why this project

This challenge blends **systems engineering + networking + full-stack** work: teams will design and operate a live access point, manage DHCP/DNS flow, integrate a blocking service, and expose a polished admin UX. It‚Äôs practical, tangible, and shows real infra + product thinking ‚Äî ideal for interviews and portfolios.

---

## 3. Scope ‚Äî what must be built

> Keep scope strict: **domain-level DNS blocking** only. No HTTPS MITM, no deep packet inspection.

### 3.1 Supported Features (must include)

1. **Laptop-hosted Wi-Fi AP (gateway)**

   * Laptop provides SSID and assigns IPs to clients.
   * Laptop acts as network gateway for the room.

2. **Real-time domain blocking**

   * Add/remove blocked domains (e.g., `facebook.com`, `twitter.com`) with immediate effect for all connected clients.
   * Blocklist persists across service restarts.

3. **Admin REST API**

   * Endpoint(s) for: listing connected clients; adding/removing domains; reading simple status.
   * Reasonable error messages and success confirmations.

4. **Mobile Admin UI (responsive)**

   * Show connected clients (IP and device identifier where available).
   * Input to add a domain and buttons to block/unblock.
   * Clear success/failure feedback and a consent notice.

5. **Demo-readiness & Documentation**

   * One-page README with start/stop instructions and explanation of limitations and consent process.
   * A 2-minute demo script teams will run for judges.

### 3.2 Excluded / Out-of-scope (do not attempt)

* Path-level or content inspection of HTTPS (no MITM).
* Guaranteed prevention of VPN/DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) bypass. Teams should document these limitations, not attempt invasive mitigations.
* Complex per-user policies (MVP rules apply to all connected devices).
* Collection of packet payloads or private data ‚Äî logging limited to domain names and timestamps only (if used).

---

## 4. System Concept (high-level only)

Teams should design the system as a small network flow:

* **Uplink:** Internet comes into the laptop from the admin‚Äôs phone (tether) or an alternate uplink.
* **Access Point & DHCP:** Laptop hands out IP addresses and ensures clients use the laptop for DNS.
* **DNS blocker:** A DNS-level filter enforces the blocked list (when clients request a blocked domain they receive a ‚Äúblocked‚Äù response).
* **Admin layer:** A small backend exposes block/unblock and client-list functions. A responsive mobile UI calls the backend and displays status.

No need to describe or provide implementation details to judges ‚Äî focus on architecture, UX, and limitations in docs.

---

## 5. Deliverables (what teams must submit)

1. **Working demo** (live or recorded) showing: connect ‚Üí block ‚Üí verify ‚Üí unblock.
2. **Backend code** (admin API + configuration / orchestration files).
3. **Mobile UI** (single-page responsive app).
4. **README.md** containing:

   * One-line start command(s).
   * How to connect a client and run the 2-minute demo.
   * Exact list of supported blocking behaviors and limitations (DoH/VPN note).
   * Short architecture diagram (single image).
5. **Demo script** (2 minutes) explaining the flow you‚Äôll show the judges.

---

## 6. Example (concrete demo scenario for judges)

Teams should prepare this exact sequence for the 2-minute demo:

1. **Start** the system and show the admin UI URL on the phone: `http://<laptop-ip>:8000`.
2. **Connect** a client device (phone or laptop) to the SSID (displayed on the laptop screen). The client should show an IP address.
3. **Show UI**: the admin UI lists the connected client (IP and short device label).
4. **Block a domain**: enter `facebook.com` in the UI and click **Block**. The UI shows confirmation.
5. **Verify**: on the client, open a browser and navigate to `facebook.com`. The page must not load (DNS resolution fails or a blocked message appears).
6. **Unblock**: click **Unblock** in the UI; on the client, reload the page and show access restored.
7. **Explain limitations**: briefly state that VPN/DoH can bypass DNS filtering and how that is handled/acknowledged.
8. **Wrap up**: show the README and explain how scoring will reflect correctness, UX, network reliability, and documentation.

---

## 7. Evaluation Criteria (rubric)

* **Core functionality (40%)** ‚Äî Blocking works reliably and immediately for all connected clients.
* **Network reliability (20%)** ‚Äî AP is stable, DHCP/DNS works correctly, clients can reach allowed sites.
* **Admin UX (20%)** ‚Äî Mobile UI is clear, responsive, and easy to operate.
* **Documentation & Demo (10%)** ‚Äî README + demo script are clear, limitations are documented.
* **Stretch / polish (10%)** ‚Äî Any extra features (logs, per-client block selection, simple auth) earn bonus points.

Judges will test at least one client device during the live demo.

---

## 8. Rules & Constraints

* **Teams:** 2 members.
* **Time:** Deliver within your hackathon allotted time.
* **Ethics:** The system must be run only in a controlled environment with explicit consent from users. Include a consent notice in the UI.
* **No external infra dependency requirement:** The demo must run locally (no paid cloud services required). Using freely-available local containers/services is fine.
* **No use of MITM or certificate installation** on judge devices without explicit permission.

---

## 9. Suggested 5‚Äì6 hour execution plan (concise)

* **0:00‚Äì0:30**: Validate laptop can host AP (or fall back to manual client DNS), confirm uplink available. Assign team roles (infra / frontend).
* **0:30‚Äì1:30**: Bring up Wi-Fi AP & DHCP; ensure a client can obtain IP + basic internet.
* **1:30‚Äì2:30**: Deploy DNS filtering component and verify DNS queries from client pass through blocker.
* **2:30‚Äì3:30**: Implement admin API endpoints (clients, block, unblock).
* **3:30‚Äì4:30**: Build mobile UI and integrate with API.
* **4:30‚Äì5:30**: Test full flow with 2 clients, finalize README and demo script.
* **5:30‚Äì6:00**: Polish UI, prepare 2-minute demo run-through.

(If AP mode is not possible on the laptop, instruct teams to use the phone hotspot and set client DNS manually for the demo.)

---

## 10. Stretch ideas (optional)

* Show last N blocked attempts in the UI (timestamp + source IP).
* Allow admin to temporarily whitelist a domain for a single client.
* Attempt simple DoH mitigation: list known DoH endpoints and explain which can/won‚Äôt be blocked.
* Add minimal authentication (shared token) for the admin API.

---

## 11. Ethics & consent (must be clear in demo)

Include this short consent text in the admin UI before enabling blocking:

> **Consent notice:** This demo blocks access to selected websites for instructional purposes only. By connecting to this network you consent to temporary blocking of sites while the demo runs. Do not join if you do not consent.

Teams must show this notice to judges at demo start.

---

## 12. Submission checklist

* Link to repo containing backend, UI, and README.
* README with simple start instructions and demo script.
* Short demo video (optional) OR be ready for live demo.
* Architecture diagram + note on limitations (DoH/VPN).

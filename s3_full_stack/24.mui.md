# Build UI with MUI using the 6 Existing APIs

## APIs You Must Use (already available in your last testing project)

1. `GET /api/companies/count`
2. `GET /api/companies/top-paid`
3. `GET /api/companies/by-skill/:skill`
4. `GET /api/companies/by-location/:location`
5. `GET /api/companies/headcount-range?min=&max=`
6. `GET /api/companies/benefit/:benefit`

---

## What You’ll Build

Using **Next.js App Router** and **Material UI (MUI)**, you will create a small set of pages that fetch data from the above APIs and display them with responsive layouts and proper theming.

You will practice:

* **Theming** (light/dark mode with `ThemeProvider`)
* **Layouts** (Container, Grid, Box)
* **Cards & Lists** (Card, Typography, Chip)
* **Navigation** between pages
* **Displaying API results** in meaningful UI patterns

---

## Routes & Tasks 

### 1. Global Layout — `app/layout.js`

* Wrap with **ThemeProvider** + `CssBaseline`.
* Add an **AppBar** with:

  * App title (Typography)
  * Light/Dark mode switch (IconButton)
  * Navigation links to other pages (e.g., Companies, Top Paid).

---

### 2. Total Companies Page — `app/companies/count/page.js`

**API**: `GET /api/companies/count`
**MUI Components**:

* `Container`, `Paper`, `Typography`, `Box`

**Task**:

* Show the total number of companies (e.g., “We have 19 companies in our database”).
* Style it inside a centered `Paper`.

---

### 3. Top Paid Companies Page — `app/companies/top-paid/page.js`

**API**: `GET /api/companies/top-paid?limit=5`
**MUI Components**:

* `Container`, `Grid`, `Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardContent`, `Chip`

**Task**:

* Display the top 5 companies by base salary.
* Each company in a `Card` showing: name, location, base salary.
* Highlight the **top 1** company with a special `Chip` (“Top Paid”).

---

### 4. Companies by Skill Page — `app/companies/by-skill/[skill]/page.js`

**API**: `GET /api/companies/by-skill/:skill`
**MUI Components**:

* `Container`, `Typography`, `Grid`, `Card`, `Chip`

**Task**:

* Create a dynamic route for skill (e.g., `/companies/by-skill/DSA`).
* Fetch companies requiring that skill and display them in cards.
* Show the skill name as a page title (`Typography` + `Chip`).

---

### 5. Companies by Location Page — `app/companies/by-location/[location]/page.js`

**API**: `GET /api/companies/by-location/:location`
**MUI Components**:

* Same as by-skill: `Container`, `Typography`, `Grid`, `Card`

**Task**:

* Create a dynamic route for location (e.g., `/companies/by-location/Hyderabad`).
* Fetch and display companies at that location.
* Show the location as a header.

---

### 6. Companies by Headcount Range Page — `app/companies/headcount-range/page.js`

**API**: `GET /api/companies/headcount-range?min=&max=`
**MUI Components**:

* `Container`, `TextField` (for min and max input), `Button`, `Grid`, `Card`

**Task**:

* Build a small form (min + max headcount input fields).
* When user clicks **Search**, call API with given min/max.
* Display results as cards.

---

### 7. Companies by Benefit Page — `app/companies/benefit/[benefit]/page.js`

**API**: `GET /api/companies/benefit/:benefit`
**MUI Components**:

* `Container`, `Typography`, `Grid`, `Card`, `Chip`

**Task**:

* Create a dynamic route for benefit (e.g., `/companies/benefit/Insurance`).
* Fetch companies that offer this benefit.
* Display cards with company name + list of benefits.

---

## What You Must Deliver

1. **Working Next.js pages** for all 6 APIs.

2. Each page should:

   * Fetch API data.
   * Use **MUI components** (Card, Grid, Typography, Chip, etc.).
   * Be **responsive** (1 column mobile, 2 tablet, 3 desktop).
   * Follow theme (light/dark mode).

3. A short **README** explaining:

   * Which API is used in each page.
   * Which MUI components were used.
   * Screenshots of at least 2 pages (list + detail).

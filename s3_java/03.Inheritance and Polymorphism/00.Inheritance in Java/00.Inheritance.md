# Inheritance in Java

Inheritance in Java is a fundamental object-oriented programming concept allowing one class to acquire the properties and behaviors (fields and methods) of another class. This mechanism promotes code reuse, improves maintainability, and supports hierarchical relationships in code.

***

## What is Inheritance?

Inheritance enables a new class (called the subclass or child class) to reuse the code from an existing class (called the superclass or parent class). The subclass inherits all public and protected members of the superclass, allowing for extended or specialized behaviors while retaining the core functionality.

### Why Use Inheritance?

- To support code reuse and reduce duplication.
- To model real-world hierarchies and relationships.
- To implement polymorphism, allowing objects to take multiple forms.
- To improve maintainability by centralizing shared behavior.

## Basic Usage Example

Below is a simple Java example showing inheritance in action.

```java
// Superclass
public class Animal {
    String name;
    void eat() {
        System.out.println(name + " is eating");
    }
}

// Subclass
public class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println(name + " is barking");
    }
}

Dog d = new Dog();
d.name = "Bruno";
d.eat();
d.bark();
```

## Step-by-Step Explanation with Visuals

| Step | Action | Explanation |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1 | Create instance of Dog | `Dog d = new Dog();` allocates memory for the object; inherits 'name' and 'eat' from 'Animal'. |
| 2 | Assign name field | `d.name = "Bruno";` sets inherited field. |
| 3 | Call eat() method | Inherited from superclass; prints "Bruno is eating". |
| 4 | Call bark() method | Defined in subclass; prints "Bruno is barking". |


***

## Visual Representation in Memory

```
Heap:
---------         -------------
| Dog d | ----->  | Dog Object |
---------         -------------
                   | name: "Bruno"   |  // inherited from Animal
                   | eat()           |  // inherited from Animal
                   | bark()          |  // defined in Dog
                   -------------
```

- The subclass object contains inherited members as well as its own defined methods and fields.
- Only a single copy of inherited fields exists for each object instance.

***

## Using super to Access Superclass Members

The `super` keyword lets the subclass access methods and fields of its superclass, even when overridden.

```java
public class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal is eating");
    }
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
    void eat() {
        super.eat(); // calls superclass method
        System.out.println("Dog is eating");
    }
}
```

When calling `d.eat()`, output will be:

```
Animal is eating
Dog is eating
```


***

## Constructor Chaining: super()

When a subclass object is created, its superclass constructor executes first (constructor chaining). Use `super()` in the subclass constructor to call the parent constructor.

```java
public class Animal {
    Animal() {
        System.out.println("Animal created");
    }
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
    Dog() {
        super();
        System.out.println("Dog created");
    }
}
```

Output:

```
Animal created
Dog created
```

## Summary Table for Inheritance

| Use Case | Description | Example |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Code reuse | Inherit fields/methods from parent | `class Dog extends Animal` |
| Override behavior | Redefine parent method in subclass | `void eat() { ... }` |
| Hierarchies | Model "is-a" relationships | Dog is an Animal |
| Constructor chaining | Call superclass constructor before subclass | `super()` |
| Polymorphism | Reference subclass as parent type | `Animal a = new Dog();` |
| Access parent members | Use `super` to reference superclass member | `super.eat()` |


***

## Additional Insights

- Private members of the superclass are not accessible by the subclass.
- Java supports single inheritance: each class can inherit from one superclass only.
- Inheritance is the base for powerful design patterns (such as Template Method, Factory, etc.).
- Constructors aren't inherited, but subclass constructors can call them using `super()`.

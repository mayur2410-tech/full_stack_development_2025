# Java Abstract Class Assignment


***

## Basic Level

### 1. What is an Abstract Class?

**Problem Statement:**
Explain what an abstract class is in Java and list its key features.

***

### 2. Abstract Class vs Concrete Class

**Problem Statement:**
Explain the differences between abstract and concrete classes in Java.

***

### 3. Create an Abstract Class

**Problem Statement:**
Define an abstract class `Animal` with an abstract method `makeSound()`. Create subclass `Dog` that overrides `makeSound()`.

***

### 4. Implement Abstract Method

**Problem Statement:**
Create abstract superclass `Shape` with abstract methods `area()` and `draw()`. Implement these in subclasses `Circle` and `Rectangle`.

***

### 5. Abstract Class Constructor

**Problem Statement:**
Demonstrate that abstract classes can have constructors and show how a subclass calls it.

***

### 6. Abstract Class Variables and Methods

**Problem Statement:**
Create an abstract class with instance variables and concrete methods. Show subclass access.

***

### 7. Abstract Class with Multiple Subclasses

**Problem Statement:**
Implement abstract class `Employee` with abstract method `calculateSalary()`. Define subclasses `Manager` and `Developer` with specific implementations.

***

### 8. Abstract Classes Cannot be Instantiated

**Problem Statement:**
Show that creating an object of abstract class directly gives compilation error.

***

### 9. Abstract Method Overriding Rules

**Problem Statement:**
Explain rules for overriding abstract methods, visibility, and exceptions.

***

### 10. Abstract Class Reference

**Problem Statement:**
Use an abstract class reference to point to subclass objects and invoke overridden methods.

***

### 11. Abstract Class vs Interface (Theoretical)

**Problem Statement:**
Explain differences and when to use abstract class instead of interface.

***

### 12. Abstract Class with Concrete Methods

**Problem Statement:**
Show that abstract classes can have fully implemented methods callable by subclasses.

***

### 13. Abstract Method with Parameters

**Problem Statement:**
Create abstract methods with parameters and implement them in subclasses.

***

### 14. Abstract Class as Base Class

**Problem Statement:**
Demonstrate using abstract class as a base class for related classes.

***

### 15. Using `super` in Abstract Classes

**Problem Statement:**
Call an abstract class method using `super` within subclass.

***

### 16. Partial Abstraction Concept

**Problem Statement:**
Explain how abstract classes provide partial abstraction in Java.

***

### 17. Abstract Class with Final Methods

**Problem Statement:**
Show that abstract classes can have final methods that cannot be overridden.

***

### 18. Abstract Classes in Java API

**Problem Statement:**
List common Java API abstract classes and their purpose.

***

### 19. Abstract Class and Polymorphism

**Problem Statement:**
Demonstrate polymorphic behavior using abstract class references.

***

### 20. Abstract Class with Static Members

**Problem Statement:**
Show abstract class usage with static variables and static methods.

***

### 21. Abstract Class and Exception Handling

**Problem Statement:**
Show exception declaration and handling in abstract and overriding methods.

***

### 22. Abstract Class and Generics (Theoretical)

**Problem Statement:**
Explain the use of generics with abstract classes.

***

### 23. Nested Abstract Classes

**Problem Statement:**
Demonstrate nested abstract classes and their use cases.

***

### 24. Abstract Class and Serialization

**Problem Statement:**
Explain how abstract classes behave with serialization.

***

### 25. Best Practices Using Abstract Classes

**Problem Statement:**
List best coding practices when designing and using abstract classes in Java.

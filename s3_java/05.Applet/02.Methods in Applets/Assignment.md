# Java Applet Graphics - Practice Assignments

## Problem 1: Basic Line Drawing

- Create an applet that draws two lines: one horizontal and one vertical intersecting at the top-left corner.
- Use `drawLine(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)` method.
- Display coordinates on the applet canvas.


## Problem 2: Rectangle Drawing and Filling

- Draw one outlined rectangle and one filled rectangle beneath it.
- Use `drawRect(int x, int y, int width, int height)` and `fillRect(int, int, int, int)`.
- Allow sizes and positions to be set via parameters.


## Problem 3: Oval Drawing and Filling

- Draw an outlined oval and a filled oval below it to illustrate difference.
- Use `drawOval(int x, int y, int width, int height)` and `fillOval(int, int, int, int)`.
- Use color changes for each oval to enhance visualization.


## Problem 4: Arc Drawing

- Draw an arc of 90 degrees and a filled arc of 270 degrees using `drawArc` and `fillArc`.
- Play with arc starting angles to display quarter and three-quarter circles.
- Label the arcs within the applet.


## Problem 5: Polygon Shape Drawing

- Draw an outlined polygon with six vertices (hexagon shape) and a filled polygon of the same shape.
- Use arrays for vertex coordinates with `drawPolygon` and `fillPolygon`.
- Experiment with polygon colors.


## Problem 6: Polyline Drawing

- Draw an open polyline connecting five points creating a zigzag shape.
- Use `drawPolyline` method.
- Differentiate from polygon by not closing the shape.


## Problem 7: Combine Drawing Methods

- Create an applet combining lines, rectangles, ovals, arcs, polygons, and polylines.
- Use colors and labels to distinguish each shape.
- Allow interaction to highlight each shape with mouse hover.


## Problem 8: Dynamic Drawing Based on User Input

- Create an applet that takes user input for shape type, dimensions, and color through parameters.
- Dynamically draw shapes as per inputs using appropriate drawing methods.
- Validate inputs and handle errors gracefully.

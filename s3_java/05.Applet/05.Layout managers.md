# Java Layout Managers: FlowLayout, BorderLayout, and GridLayout


***

## What is a Layout Manager?

A **layout manager** automatically arranges and sizes the components inside a container (like a JFrame or JPanel) according to specific rules. This ensures that the GUI adapts well to resizing and different screen resolutions without manual calculations.

Java provides several built-in layout managers, with FlowLayout, BorderLayout, and GridLayout being the most commonly used.

***

## 1. FlowLayout

### Description

- **FlowLayout** places components in a directional flow, much like text in a paragraph.
- Components are arranged **left to right** in one or multiple rows.
- When no more components fit in the row, the layout wraps them to next line.
- Components retain their preferred size.
- Alignment options:
    - Center (default)
    - Left
    - Right
- Can set horizontal/vertical gaps between components.


### Constructor Options

- `FlowLayout()`: Defaults to centered alignment, 5 px gaps.
- `FlowLayout(int align)`: Alignment can be set to LEFT, RIGHT, or CENTER.
- `FlowLayout(int align, int hgap, int vgap)`: Alignment with custom gaps.


### Appearance

```
+---------------------------------------+
| Button1  Button2  Button3  Button4    |
| Button5  Button6                      |
+---------------------------------------+
(Components flow left to right and wrap based on container width)
```


### Example

```java
JPanel panel = new JPanel();
panel.setLayout(new FlowLayout(FlowLayout.LEFT, 10, 20));  // Left aligned, 10 px horizontal, 20 px vertical gap
panel.add(new JButton("Button1"));
panel.add(new JButton("Button2"));
panel.add(new JButton("Button3"));
```

Use for toolbars, button groups, or simple sequential layouts.

***

- Places components sequentially in a row, like text in a paragraph.
- Components flow left to right, wrapping to the next line when needed.
- Retains components' preferred sizes.
- Supports alignment: center (default), left, and right.
- Allows customizing horizontal (`hgap`) and vertical (`vgap`) gaps.


### Usage

Used in toolbars, button groups, or simple sequential arrangements.

### Example

```java
JPanel panel = new JPanel();
panel.setLayout(new FlowLayout(FlowLayout.LEFT, 10, 15));
panel.add(new JButton("One"));
panel.add(new JButton("Two"));
panel.add(new JButton("Three"));
```


### Visual

```
+---------------------------------------+
| One  Two  Three                      ...|
+---------------------------------------+
(Wraps to next line if insufficient width)
```

## 2. BorderLayout

### Description

- Divides the container into five regions:
    - **North** (top)
    - **South** (bottom)
    - **East** (right)
    - **West** (left)
    - **Center** (middle)
- Each region contains zero or one component.
- North/South spans the full width, East/West fills left/right sides.
- Center takes all remaining space.
- Supports horizontal and vertical gaps between regions.


### Constructor Options

- `BorderLayout()`: No gap by default.
- `BorderLayout(int hgap, int vgap)`: Sets horizontal and vertical gaps.


### Appearance

```
+-----------------------+
|        NORTH          |
+--------+ +------------+
| WEST   | |   EAST     |
|        | |            |
+--------+ +------------+
|       CENTER           |
+-----------------------+
|        SOUTH          |
+-----------------------+
```


### Example

```java
JFrame frame = new JFrame();
frame.setLayout(new BorderLayout(5, 5));  // 5px gaps
frame.add(new JButton("North"), BorderLayout.NORTH);
frame.add(new JButton("South"), BorderLayout.SOUTH);
frame.add(new JButton("East"), BorderLayout.EAST);
frame.add(new JButton("West"), BorderLayout.WEST);
frame.add(new JButton("Center"), BorderLayout.CENTER);
```

Perfect for main application windows to structure content logically.

***

- Divides container into five areas: North, South, East, West, and Center.
- North/South occupy full width on top/bottom.
- East/West offered on sides, take remaining height.
- Center fills remaining space.
- Supports gaps between regions.


### Usage

Ideal for main windows or dialogs needing distinct functional areas.

### Example

```java
JFrame frame = new JFrame();
frame.setLayout(new BorderLayout(5, 5));
frame.add(new JButton("North"), BorderLayout.NORTH);
frame.add(new JButton("South"), BorderLayout.SOUTH);
frame.add(new JButton("East"), BorderLayout.EAST);
frame.add(new JButton("West"), BorderLayout.WEST);
frame.add(new JButton("Center"), BorderLayout.CENTER);
```


### Visual

```
+-------------------+
|      North        |
+---------+---------+
| West | Center | East |
+---------+---------+
|      South        |
+-------------------+
```

## 3. GridLayout

### Description

- Arranges components in an equally sized grid.
- You define the number of rows and columns.
- Components fill cells left to right, top to bottom.
- All cells maintain equal size.
- Gaps can be added between the rows and columns.


### Constructor Options

- `GridLayout(int rows, int cols)`: Defines number of rows and columns.
- `GridLayout(int rows, int cols, int hgap, int vgap)`: Adds horizontal and vertical spacing.


### Appearance

```
+-----+-----+-----+
| Btn | Btn | Btn |
+-----+-----+-----+
| Btn | Btn | Btn |
+-----+-----+-----+
```


### Example

```java
JPanel panel = new JPanel(new GridLayout(2, 3, 10, 15));  // 2 rows, 3 columns, 10px hgap, 15px vgap
for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
    panel.add(new JButton("Button " + i));
}
```

Ideal for buttons, controls, or dashboards needing uniform cell sizes.

***
- Arranges components in a grid with fixed rows and columns.
- Each cell has the same size.
- Components are added from left to right, top to bottom.
- Resizes all cells uniformly.
- Supports horizontal and vertical gaps.


### Usage

Best for calculators, keypads, or control panels.

### Example

```java
JPanel panel = new JPanel(new GridLayout(2, 3, 5, 5));
for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
    panel.add(new JButton("Button " + i));
}
```


### Visual

```
+-----+-----+-----+
| Btn1| Btn2| Btn3|
+-----+-----+-----+
| Btn4| Btn5| Btn6|
+-----+-----+-----+
(Equal-sized grid cells)
```

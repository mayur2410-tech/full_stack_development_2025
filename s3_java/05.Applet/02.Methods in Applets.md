# Java Applet Drawing Methods:


***

## 1. Drawing Lines with `drawLine`

### Description:

The `drawLine(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)` method in the `Graphics` class draws a straight line segment between two points.

- `(x1, y1)`: The starting point coordinates.
- `(x2, y2)`: The ending point coordinates.


### Use Case:

Drawing shapes, borders, paths, or simple lines in graphics applications.

***

### Example:

```java
public void paint(Graphics g) {
    g.drawLine(10, 10, 150, 10);  // Horizontal line at top
    g.drawLine(10, 10, 10, 150);  // Vertical line at left
}
```

- The first call draws a horizontal line from `(10, 10)` to `(150, 10)`.
- The second draws a vertical line from `(10, 10)` to `(10, 150)`.

***

## 2. Drawing Rectangles with `drawRect` and `fillRect`

### Description:

- `drawRect(int x, int y, int width, int height)` draws the outline of a rectangle.
- `(x, y)` are coordinates of the rectangle’s upper-left corner.
- `width` and `height` specify the rectangle’s dimensions.
- `fillRect(int x, int y, int width, int height)` draws a filled rectangle with the same parameters.


### Use Case:

To display bordered or solid rectangular shapes, buttons, panels, or highlights.

***

### Example:

```java
public void paint(Graphics g) {
    g.drawRect(20, 20, 100, 50);   // Outlined rectangle
    g.fillRect(20, 80, 100, 50);   // Filled rectangle
}
```

- The first rectangle is an outline starting at `(20,20)` with width 100 and height 50.
- The second is a filled rectangle positioned below.

***

## 3. Drawing Ovals with `drawOval` and `fillOval`

### Description:

- `drawOval(int x, int y, int width, int height)` draws an oval inscribed within the bounding rectangle defined by `(x, y, width, height)`.
- `fillOval(int x, int y, int width, int height)` draws a filled version of the oval.


### Use Case:

To draw circles, ellipses, or curved shapes for graphics or GUIs.

***

### Example:

```java
public void paint(Graphics g) {
    g.drawOval(150, 20, 100, 50);  // Outlined oval
    g.fillOval(150, 80, 100, 50);  // Filled oval
}
```

- The drawing starts at `(150,20)` bounding rectangle with given width and height.

***

## 4. Drawing Arcs with `drawArc` and `fillArc`

### Description:

- `drawArc(int x, int y, int width, int height, int startAngle, int arcAngle)` draws an arc (part of oval) enclosed in the bounding rectangle.
- `startAngle`: The starting angle in degrees (0° at 3 o’clock, positive angles move counterclockwise).
- `arcAngle`: The angular extent of the arc in degrees.
- `fillArc(...)` draws the filled version.


### Use Case:

To draw pie slices, curved sections, or circular progress indicators.

***

### Example:

```java
public void paint(Graphics g) {
    g.drawArc(280, 20, 100, 100, 0, 90);     // Quarter circle arc outline
    g.fillArc(280, 140, 100, 100, 0, 270);   // Three quarter arc filled
}
```

- The first arc is a 90-degree slice starting at 0°.
- The second is a filled 270-degree arc.

***

## 5. Drawing Polygons with `drawPolygon` and `fillPolygon`

### Description:

- `drawPolygon(int[] xPoints, int[] yPoints, int nPoints)` draws the outline of a polygon with vertices defined by parallel arrays of x- and y-coordinates.
- The polygon is automatically closed by connecting the last point to the first.
- `fillPolygon(...)` fills the polygon area.


### Use Case:

To draw complex multi-sided shapes and irregular polygons.

***

### Example:

```java
public void paint(Graphics g) {
    int[] xPoints = {50, 70, 90, 90, 70, 50};
    int[] yPoints = {150, 130, 130, 150, 170, 170};
    int nPoints = 6;

    g.drawPolygon(xPoints, yPoints, nPoints);     // Polygon outline
    g.fillPolygon(xPoints, yPoints, nPoints);     // Filled polygon (drawn again for visual effect)
}
```

- Arrays define a hexagonal shape via six points.

***

## 6. Drawing Polylines with `drawPolyline`

### Description:

- `drawPolyline(int[] xPoints, int[] yPoints, int nPoints)` draws connected line segments between points defined by the arrays.
- **Does not** close the shape by linking the last point to the first.


### Use Case:

To draw open shapes such as zigzags, curves, or freeform paths.

***

### Example:

```java
public void paint(Graphics g) {
    int[] xPoints = {150, 170, 190, 210, 230};
    int[] yPoints = {150, 130, 170, 130, 150};
    int nPoints = 5;

    g.drawPolyline(xPoints, yPoints, nPoints);
}
```

- Draws a zigzag or wave pattern by connecting points.

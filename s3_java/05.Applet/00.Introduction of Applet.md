## Introduction to Java Applet

A **Java Applet** is a small Java program embedded within a web page executed inside the web browser or applet viewer. Applets enable dynamic, interactive content on web pages like animations or graphical interfaces. Unlike regular applications, applets rely on the browser to control their lifecycle and run in a sandboxed, secure environment.

## Life Cycle of a Java Applet

The applet life cycle consists of defined methods invoked automatically by the browser/app environment during various stages:

### Lifecycle Methods and Flow

```
    +-----------+
    |  init()   |
    +-----+-----+
          |
          v
    +-----------+
    |  start()  |
    +-----+-----+
          |
          v
   +--------------+
   |   paint()    |<-----------------------------+
   +--------------+                              |
          |                                     User interactions
          v                                     Trigger repaint
    +------------+                              
    |   stop()   |                              
    +-----+------+                              
          |                                      
          v                                   
    +-------------+
    |  destroy()  |
    +-------------+
```

### Explanation of Life Cycle Methods

- **`init()`**: Initializes the applet once when first loaded. Used for setup and resource allocation.
- **`start()`**: Called after `init()` and each time the applet becomes active (e.g., user returns to page). Launches animations or threads.
- **`paint()`**: Called when the applet is displayed or needs repainting.
- **`stop()`**: Called when the applet is no longer visible. Used to pause activities.
- **`destroy()`**: Called when the applet is unloaded, for cleanup and resource release.

## Visual Flowchart of Applet Lifecycle

```plaintext
+-----------------+
|   Browser loads  |
|    HTML page     |
+--------+--------+
         |
         v
+-----------------+
|     init()      |  <-- Called once when applet loads
+--------+--------+
         |
         v
+-----------------+
|    start()      |  <-- Called after init and when user returns
+--------+--------+
         |
         v
+-----------------+       +----------------+
|    paint()      | <---- |    Event or    |
+--------+--------+       |  screen refresh|
         |                +----------------+
         v
+-----------------+
|     stop()      |  <-- Called on leaving page or tab switching
+--------+--------+
         |
         v
+-----------------+
|    destroy()    |  <-- Called on browser shutdown or applet removal
+-----------------+
```

## Comparison Between Applets and Applications

| Feature | Java Applets | Java Applications |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Execution environment | Runs inside web browser/applet viewer | Runs on standalone JVM |
| Entry point | No `main()` method; lifecycle methods used | `main()` method starts the application |
| Security | Sandbox restrictions; limited access | Full access to system resources |
| UI Rendering | Embedded in browser window | Runs in independent windows (AWT, Swing) |
| Deployment | Part of HTML web page, downloaded on demand | Packaged as JAR/executable, standalone launch |
| Resource management | Controlled by browser lifecycle | Controlled by application |
| Use case | Small interactive web components | Full-scale software and utilities |

## Additional Details

- Applets run in a **restricted environment** to protect users and systems.
- They allow small programs to be **transmitted over the internet** and run without installation.
- Applets are **obsolete in modern browsers** due to security risks and replaced by newer web technologies.

# Java Conditionals and Loops Assignment

## Basic-Level

1. **What is a Conditional Statement?**
Explain what a conditional statement is and why it is used in Java programming.

2. **If Statement Syntax and Example**
Problem Statement:
Write a program that checks whether a given integer is positive. If it is positive, print `"Positive"`.
Example:
- Input:

```  
10  
```

- Output:

```  
Positive  
```

3. **If-Else Statement Practice**
Problem Statement:
Write a program that takes an integer input and prints `"Even"` if the number is even, or `"Odd"` otherwise.
Example:
- Input:

```  
7  
```

- Output:

```  
Odd  
```

4. **Else-If Ladder**
Problem Statement:
Write a program that reads an integer representing marks and outputs the grade as follows:
    - Marks >= 90 : "A"
    - Marks >= 80 and < 90 : "B"
    - Marks >= 70 and < 80 : "C"
    - Marks < 70 : "F"
Example:
- Input:

```  
85  
```

- Output:

```  
B  
```

5. **Switch Statement Example**
Problem Statement:
Write a program that takes a number representing the day of the week (1 for Monday to 7 for Sunday) and prints the name of the day.
Example:
- Input:

```  
3  
```

- Output:

```  
Wednesday  
```

6. **Nested If Statements**
Problem Statement:
Write a program to check if a number is positive, negative or zero, and additionally check if it is even or odd if itâ€™s not zero.
Example:
- Input:

```  
-4  
```

- Output:

```  
Negative  
```

7. **Ternary Operator Usage**
Problem Statement:
Write a program that uses the ternary operator to find and print the minimum of two integers.
Example:
- Input:

```  
7 10  
```

- Output:

```  
7  
```

8. **Logical Operators in Conditions**
Problem Statement:
Write a program that accepts an integer and prints `"Yes"` if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, else prints `"No"`.
Example:
- Input:

```  
15  
```

- Output:

```  
Yes  
```

9. **Check Vowel or Consonant**
Problem Statement:
Write a program that checks if a given alphabet character is a vowel or a consonant.
Example:
- Input:

```  
a  
```

- Output:

```  
Vowel  
```

10. **Nested Switch**
Problem Statement:
Write a program that takes two integers `a` and `b`, and a character `op` for operation (+, -, *, /). Use a switch statement nested with another switch or if for different operations and print the result.
Example:
- Input:

```  
5 3 +  
```

- Output:

```  
8  
```

11. **For Loop to Print Numbers**
Problem Statement:
Write a program that uses a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is input by the user.
Example:
- Input:

```  
5  
```

- Output:

```  
1  
2  
3  
4  
5  
```

12. **Sum of Natural Numbers Using Loop**
Problem Statement:
Write a program to calculate the sum of the first `n` natural numbers using a loop.
Example:
- Input:

```  
4  
```

- Output:

```  
10  
```

13. **While Loop Example**
Problem Statement:
Write a program to print all even numbers less than or equal to `n` using a `while` loop.
Example:
- Input:

```  
10  
```

- Output:

```  
2 4 6 8 10  
```

14. **Do-While Loop Practice**
Problem Statement:
Write a program to keep asking the user for a number until they input a number greater than 100 using a `do-while` loop. Print the entered number when it is valid.
Example:
- Input:

```  
45  
78  
102  
```

- Output:

```  
102  
```

15. **Break Statement in Loop**
Problem Statement:
Write a program to find the smallest integer greater than zero that is divisible by both 4 and 7, using a loop and break statement.
Example:
- Output:

```  
28  
```

16. **Continue Statement in Loop**
Problem Statement:
Write a program to print all numbers from 1 to 10 except multiples of 3 using a loop and continue.
Example:
- Output:

```  
1 2 4 5 7 8 10  
```

17. **Sum of Digits of a Number**
Problem Statement:
Write a program to calculate the sum of digits of an integer input by the user using loops.
Example:
- Input:

```  
234  
```

- Output:

```  
9  
```

18. **Factorial Calculation**
Problem Statement:
Write a program that calculates and prints the factorial of a number `n` using a loop.
Example:
- Input:

```  
5  
```

- Output:

```  
120  
```

19. **Fibonacci Series**
Problem Statement:
Write a program to print the first `n` numbers of the Fibonacci series using a loop.
Example:
- Input:

```  
6  
```

- Output:

```  
0 1 1 2 3 5  
```

20. **Check Prime Number**
Problem Statement:
Write a program to check whether a number is prime or not using loops and conditionals.
Example:
- Input:

```  
13  
```

- Output:

```  
Prime  
```

Problem Statement:
Write a program using nested loops to print the multiplication table for numbers 1 to 5.
Example:
    - Output (partial):

```  
1 x 1 = 1  
1 x 2 = 2  
...  
5 x 5 = 25  
```

22. **Pattern Printing - Pyramid**

```
   *  
  ***  
 *****  
*******  
```

23. **Palindrome Number Using Loops**
Problem Statement:
Write a program to check if a given integer is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward).
Example:
- Input:

```  
121  
```

- Output:

```

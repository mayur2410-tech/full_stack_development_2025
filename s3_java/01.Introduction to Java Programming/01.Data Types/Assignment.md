## Basic-Level

1. Explain the size and range of each Java primitive data type.
2. What is the default value of all primitive data types when declared as class fields?
3. Write a program that demonstrates automatic type promotion in arithmetic expressions with `byte`, `short`, and `char`.
4. Explain how to declare and initialize a `long` literal correctly.
5. What happens when you try to assign a floating-point literal to an `int` variable without casting?
6. Show how to safely cast a `double` value to a `float` and explain potential precision loss.
7. Explain the difference between signed and unsigned types in Java primitives.
8. Write code to demonstrate the use of a `boolean` primitive and its default value behavior.
9. How does integer division behave with `int` and `long` types in Java?
10. Explain the difference between the `char` data type and `byte` in terms of storage and range.

## Medium-Level

11. Implement a method that checks if a given `int` value is within the range of a `byte` without causing overflow.
12. Demonstrate how to perform bitwise operations (`AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, `NOT`) on two `byte` variables and explain the results.
13. Describe autoboxing and unboxing with examples showing potential pitfalls when a wrapper object is `null`.
14. Write a Java snippet to compare two `Integer` objects for value equality and reference equality; explain the difference.
15. Explain and demonstrate how Java handles arithmetic overflow and underflow with primitive integer types.
16. Write a method that converts a primitive `char` to its numeric Unicode value and back to a `char`.
17. What happens if you unbox a `null` wrapper object to its corresponding primitive type? Show with an example.
18. Write code to parse an integer value from a `String` using wrapper class methods without using exception handling.
19. How does Java handle default char literals in expressions? Write an example adding a character to an integer.
20. Write code to demonstrate precision loss when converting a large `long` number to a `float`.

## Hard-Level

21. Create a method that safely adds two `int` numbers and detects overflow, returning a boolean indicating overflow status.
22. Explain the difference in memory usage and behavior between primitives and wrapper classes with examples.
23. Discuss how Java represents `boolean` internally and why its size is not precisely defined.
24. Write a method to manually implement the unboxing of an `Integer` wrapper object to `int` with null checks.
25. Describe and demonstrate the behavior of compound assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`) with primitive types and how they handle type casting.

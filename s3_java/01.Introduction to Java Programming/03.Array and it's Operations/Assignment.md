# Java Array Assignment

## Basic-Level

1. **What is an Array in Java?**
Explain what an array is in Java and how it differs from other data structures like lists.

2. **Array Declaration and Initialization**
Describe the syntax for declaring and initializing arrays in Java. Provide code examples using both primitive and object arrays.

3. **Default Values in Arrays**
What are the default values for elements in a newly created array of primitive types and an array of reference types in Java?

4. **Fixed and Dynamic Array Size**
Explain why arrays in Java have a fixed length and how dynamic resizing can be handled using other data structures.

5. **Print All Elements in Array**
Problem Statement:
Write a method that takes an integer array as input and prints each element on a separate line.
Example:
- Input:

```
[12, 7, 9]
```

- Output:

```
12
7
9
```

6. **Accessing Array Elements**
Describe how elements are accessed and indexed in a Java array. Illustrate with a sample array access.

7. **Find Maximum in Array**
Problem Statement:
Write a method that finds and returns the largest element in an integer array.
Example:
- Input:

```
[4, 8, 1, 6]
```

- Output:

```
8
```

8. **Update Value at Index**
Problem Statement:
Write a method that updates an element at a specified index in a string array and returns the modified array.
Example:
- Input:

```
["red", "blue", "green"], 1, "yellow"
```

- Output:

```
["red", "yellow", "green"]
```

9. **Array Length Property**
How can you determine the length of an array in Java? Demonstrate with code.

10. **Reverse Array Elements**
Problem Statement:
Write a method that takes an integer array and returns a new array with elements in reverse order.
Example:

- Input:

```
[3, 5, 2, 8]
```

- Output:

```
[8, 2, 5, 3]
```

## Medium-Level

11. **Sum of Array Elements**
Problem Statement:
Write a method that calculates and returns the sum of all elements in a given integer array.
Example:
- Input:

```
[2, 4, 6]
```

- Output:

```
12
```

12. **Count Occurrences of an Element**
Problem Statement:
Write a method that counts the number of times a given value appears in an integer array.
Example:
- Input:

```
[5, 3, 5, 2, 5], value = 5
```

- Output:

```
3
```

13. **Copy Array Elements**
Problem Statement:
Write code to copy all elements from one array to another and return the new array.
Example:
- Input:

```
[1, 2, 3]
```

- Output:

```
[1, 2, 3]
```

14. **Find Index of Element**
Problem Statement:
Write a method to find and return the index of the first occurrence of a given element in an array. If not found, return `-1`.
Example:
- Input:

```
[7, 8, 9, 8], value = 8
```

- Output:

```
1
```

15. **Array Sorting**
Problem Statement:
Write a method to sort an integer array in ascending order and return the sorted array.
Example:
- Input:

```
[3, 1, 2]
```

- Output:

```
[1, 2, 3]
```

16. **Split and Merge Arrays**
Problem Statement:
Given two integer arrays, merge them into a single array and return the merged array.
Example:
- Input:

```
[1, 2], [3, 4]
```

- Output:

```
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

17. **Find Minimum Value**
Problem Statement:
Write a method that finds and returns the smallest value in an integer array.
Example:
- Input:

```
[5, 2, 9, 1]
```

- Output:

```
1
```

18. **Find Second Largest Element**
Problem Statement:
Write a method that finds and returns the second largest element in an array of integers.
Example:
- Input:

```
[4, 7, 2, 9]
```

- Output:

```
7
```

19. **Array Rotation**
Problem Statement:
Write a method that rotates elements of an integer array to the right by one position and returns the new array.
Example:
- Input:

```
[10, 20, 30, 40]
```

- Output:

```
[40, 10, 20, 30]
```

20. **Find Duplicate Elements**
Problem Statement:
Write a method that returns a list of all elements that appear more than once in an integer array.
Example:
- Input:

```
[1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 1]
```

- Output:

```
[1, 2]
```

## Hard-Level

21. **Remove Duplicates from Array**
Problem Statement:
Write a method that removes all duplicate elements from an integer array and returns a new array containing only unique elements.
Example:
- Input:

```
[5, 3, 5, 2, 3]
```

- Output:

```
[5, 3, 2]
```

22. **Find Intersection of Two Arrays**
Problem Statement:
Write a method that takes two integer arrays and returns a new array containing their intersection (common elements).

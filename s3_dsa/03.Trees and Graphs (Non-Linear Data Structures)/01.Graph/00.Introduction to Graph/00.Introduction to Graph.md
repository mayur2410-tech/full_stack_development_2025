# Graph Data Structure

## Introduction and Definition

A **Graph** is a foundational data structure in computer science, representing a collection of objects (called **vertices**) and the connections (**edges**) between them. Unlike linear or hierarchical structures, graphs model complex, arbitrary relationships and are widely used for networks, maps, workflows, and social connections.

***

## Key Concepts in Graphs

- **Vertices (Nodes):** Fundamental entities of the graph.
- **Edges (Links):** Connections between pairs of vertices, indicating relationships.
- **Adjacency:** Vertices are adjacent if connected directly by an edge.
- **Degree:** Number of edges incident to a vertex (split as in-degree/out-degree for directed graphs).
- **Paths:** Sequences of vertices where each is connected to the next by an edge.
- **Cycles:** Paths which start and end at the same vertex.
- **Connected Components:** Groups of vertices all mutually reachable.

   \             \      /   \
    \             \    /     \
     \             \ /       /
      [E] -------- [F] ---- [G]

 Legend:
 [X]           : Vertex (Node)
 --------      : Undirected Edge
 Arrow (→)     : Directed Edge (not shown in this undirected example)
 Numbers       : Edge weights (in weighted graphs)
```

- **Vertices:** Each lettered bracket (e.g., [A], [B]) is a node.
- **Edges:** Lines connecting pairs of vertices.
- **Degree:** [F] has the most connections here.
- **Cycle:** One example is [A]-[B]-[F]-[E]-[C]-[A].
- **Connected:** All nodes are in one connected component.

## Components of a Graph

- **Vertices (Nodes):** Represent data points or entities.
- **Edges (Links):** Show relationships, connections, or flows between vertices.
- **Adjacency:** Describes direct connectiveness of pairs.
- **Paths/Cycles:** Indicate movement or flow within the network.
- **Components:** Islands of connectivity in a graph.

## Types of Graph in Data Structures

Below are the essential types, each described in detail and with clear visual cues.

***

### Null Graph

- **Definition:** A graph with nodes only; **no edges** connect any nodes.
- **Properties:**
    - All vertices are completely isolated.
    - No relationships or interactions exist.
    - Degree of all vertices is zero.
- **Use Case:** Models entirely disjoint entities.

```
 [A]   [B]   [C]
```


***

### Undirected Graph

- **Definition:** A graph where **edges have no direction**; connections are two-way.
- **Properties:**
    - Each edge is bidirectional (A–B = B–A).
    - Typically used when the relationship is symmetric.
    - Degree of a vertex = number of connections.
- **Use Case:** Social networks, road maps.

```
 [A] ----- [B]
  |
 [C]
```


***

### Directed Graph (Digraph)

- **Definition:** Each edge has a defined **direction** (from source to destination).
- **Properties:**
    - Edges are ordered pairs; A→B is distinct from B→A.
    - Vertices have **in-degree** (incoming edges) and **out-degree** (outgoing edges).
    - Models asymmetric relationships.
- **Use Case:** Web links, task scheduling, citation networks.

```
 [A] → [B]
  ↓
 [C]
```


***

### Connected Graph

- **Definition:** In an undirected graph, every vertex is **reachable** from every other vertex through a sequence of edges.
- **Properties:**
    - There exists at least one path between every pair.
    - The graph is one single component.
- **Use Case:** Design where universal access or communication is necessary.

```
 [A]--[B]
   \  /
   [C]
```


***

### Disconnected Graph

- **Definition:** At least two vertices **cannot reach** each other; the graph is split into isolated “components.”
- **Properties:**
    - At least one node or group is isolated.
    - Multiple connected components may exist.
- **Use Case:** Separate clusters in a network, or parts of a map with no connecting route.

```
 [A]   [B]
  |     
 [C]

 [D]
```


***

### Regular Graph

- **Definition:** Every vertex has the **same degree** (same number of connections).
- **Properties:**
    - Degree uniformity applies globally.
    - Can be undirected or directed.
- **Use Case:** Some communication or network topologies; graphs with balanced structure.

```
 [A]---[B]
  |      |
 [C]---[D]
```

- All nodes have degree 2.

***

### Complete Graph

- **Definition:** Every possible pair of different vertices is **directly connected** by an edge.
- **Properties:**
    - Maximally dense — “all-to-all” connections.
    - For n vertices, total edges: n(n-1)/2 (undirected).
- **Use Case:** Fully connected mesh networks.

```
 [A]---[B]
  |\   /|
  | \ / |
 [C]---[D]
```

- All pairs are connected.

***

### Cyclic Graph

- **Definition:** Contains at least one **cycle** (closed path).
- **Properties:**
    - Cycles allow returning to origin by unique path.
    - May be directed or undirected.
- **Use Case:** Routing systems, feedback networks.

```
 [A]---[B]
  |     |
 [C]---[D]
```

- Path A–B–D–C–A is a cycle.

***

### Acyclic Graph

- **Definition:** **No cycles** exist in the structure.
- **Properties:**
    - Traversal never revisits a vertex.
    - Trees are simple acyclic graphs.
- **Use Case:** Hierarchies, dependency trees.

```
 [A]     [B]
  |       |
 [C]     [D]
```


***

### Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

- **Definition:** A **directed graph** with **no cycles**.
- **Properties:**
    - Directionality and acyclicity together.
    - Essential for scheduling and dependency resolution.
- **Use Case:** Task scheduling, expression evaluation, version control.

```
 [A] → [B] → [C]
   ↘
     → [D]
```


***

### Weighted Graph

- **Definition:** Edges carry a **weight**, representing cost, length, or capacity.
- **Properties:**
    - Weights can be positive, negative, or zero.
    - Both directed and undirected.
- **Use Case:** Maps (distances), cost optimizations (networks), routing algorithms.

**Simple Visual Representation:**

```
   4
 [A]-----[B]
  |      /
2 |     3
  |   /
 [C]

Legend:
- [A], [B], [C]    : Vertices (nodes)
- Lines            : Edges (connections)
- Numbers on edges : Weights (e.g., distance, cost)
- Degree           : Number of lines touching a node (A is degree 2)
```

- Edge [A]–[B] has weight 4.
- Edge [A]–[C] has weight 2.
- Edge [B]–[C] has weight 3.

## Difference between Tree and Graph

| Aspect | Tree | Graph |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Definition** | A connected, acyclic, hierarchical structure with one root. | A collection of vertices connected by edges with no strict hierarchy. |
| **Structure** | Single root node; each node (except root) has one parent. | No root; nodes can have multiple arbitrary connections. |
| **Cycles** | No cycles (acyclic). | Can contain cycles (cyclic or acyclic). |
| **Connectivity** | Always connected (one connected component). | Can be connected or disconnected. |
| **Edges** | Usually directed from parent to child or undirected straight tree edges. | Can be directed or undirected with flexible connections. |
| **Node Degree** | Each node has exactly one parent (except root). | Nodes can have any number of edges (degree varies). |
| **Use Cases** | Hierarchical data — file systems, organizational charts. | Networks, social media, maps, task scheduling, etc. |
| **Traversal** | Preorder, inorder, postorder for processing hierarchies. | BFS, DFS for exploring arbitrary connectivity. |

- **Transportation Systems:** Junctions or stations as vertices; roads, rails, or flight routes as edges.
- **Computer Networks:** Devices as vertices; physical/wireless links as edges.
- **Web Page Linking:** Pages as nodes; hyperlinks as directed edges.
- **Recommendation Engines:** Items or users connected by weighted edges indicating similarity or preferences.
- **Task Scheduling and Dependencies:** Tasks as nodes; dependencies as directed edges forming DAGs.
- **Geographic Information Systems (GIS):** Locations as vertices; routes as edges for navigation.
- **Electrical Circuits:** Components as nodes; connections as edges representing relationships.
- **Knowledge Representation:** Entities and their relationships mapped as graphs to model complex linkages.
- **Game Development:** Game states or objects as vertices; legal moves or interactions as edges.

### Example Visual of Applications

**Social Network:**

```
     [User1]

## Extended Notes

- Graphs generalize relationships and are not limited to a specific layout or order.
- Choice of type (directed/undirected, weighted/unweighted, etc.) depends on real-world semantics.
- Applications include route finding (maps), resource allocation, workflow planning, and complex network analysis.
- Core operations are traversal, searching, cycle detection, and connectivity checks.
